	First of all - let me apologize for not being able to welcome you to the team and show you the ropes in person.<br><br>
	Away missions have been increasingly demanding as of late and I'm scheduled for departure right before your arrival.<br><br>
	Regardless, you came as a recommended as a highly capable individual and should have no problem getting familiarized with our setup.<br>
	Here are the basic instructions for running out turbine generators:<br><br>
	<b>1:</b> Make sure the flow pumps from the O2 and Plasma chambers are enabled and pumping gas into the mixer.<br>
	<b>2:</b> Configure the mixer's ratios and enable it (when in doubt - set it to 50/50).<br>
	<b>3:</b> Note the gas flow meeter to ensure the gas is flowing and enable the pumps along the pipleline leading into the ignition chambers (there should be 2 pumps per side, 1 directly after the mixer and 1 right before the chamber).<br>
	<b>4:</b> Ensuring that all doors are properly secured you may initiate the ignition by using the button next to the door controller.<br>
	<b>5:</b> Open the exterior output blast doors so the turbine does not overheat.<br>
	<b>6:</b> Initiate the turbine boot up procedure on the console and configure the SMES units to evenly match the output.<br><br>
	Best of luck to you! With me out - you're in charge of keeping this place patched up and running.<br><br>
